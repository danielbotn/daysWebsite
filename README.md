# Days website

Days is a mobile application written in react native. The source code for that project will be open sourced soon. On the other hand, this project is a "static" website to advertise the mobile app.

This project was scaffolded with the Eleventy Starter. 11ty is a static site generator. With the help of a few other tools listed below, 11ty has been turned into a reactive javascript framework, like react or angular.  
The following technology is used in the project:

- [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) for templates and site generation.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) for straightforward JS asset bundling.
- [Alpine JS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) A rugged, minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your markup.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for a utility first CSS workflow.
- [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/) for optimizing css output.
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) A template engine similar to pug or ejs

### Redirects and proxies

Netlify's Redirects API can provide friendlier URLs as proxies to these URLs.
